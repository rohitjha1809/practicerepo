git clone <http> vs git remote add origin <http>:
>> git clone <http> clones the whole remote(git) repo to the local repo. Then we can work and make changes then add, commit and push changes.
>> git add remote origin <http> establishes connection between remote(repo) and local repo. Once you have set the "origin," you can use other Git commands like git push, git pull, and git fetch to interact with the remote repository, sharing changes and collaborating with other developers.
