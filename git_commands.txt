git clone <http> vs git remote add origin <http>:
>> git clone <http> clones the whole remote(git) repo to the local repo. Then we can work and make changes then add, commit and push changes.
>> git add remote origin <http> establishes connection between remote(repo) and local repo. Once you have set the "origin," you can use other Git commands like git push, git pull, and git fetch to interact with the remote repository, sharing changes and collaborating with other developers.



Centralized Version Control System vs Distributed Version Control System:
>> In CVCS the code stays in the server and everytime user has to login to server make changes.
>>In DVCS the code stays in the server and a copy of that also stays with all the user, the user can make changes in the local repo and push the changes to the server when ever he logs in.



git workflow and stages:

The typical Git workflow involves the following stages:
>>Creating or Modifying Files: 
When you create or modify files in your working directory, they are initially untracked. Git is not yet aware of these changes.

>>Adding Changes to the Staging Area:
To include the changes in the next commit, you use the git add command to stage the files.
The git add command moves the changes from the working directory to the staging area.

>>Creating a Commit:
After staging the changes, you create a commit using the git commit command.
The git commit command permanently saves the changes in the Git repository along with a commit message that describes the changes.

>>Pushing the changes:
The primary purpose of git push is to synchronize your local commits and changes with the corresponding branch in the remote repository. It updates the remote repository with the work you have done locally.



Steps to merge branches to bring changes from master to main branch:
>> First add, commit and push all the changes made in the master branch-
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "message"
	$ git push orgin master
>>Checkout to the main - $ git checkout main
>>Merge branch master to main - $ git merge master
>>Now add, commit and push all the merge made in the made branch-
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "message"
	$ git push orgin main
	
#>> Git is a software and github or git lab is a service.
